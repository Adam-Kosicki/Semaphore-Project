# Semaphore-Project
JAVA | Threads, sempahores

This Java project uses semaphores to simulate a DMV office with multiple customers and agents. Customers are represented by threads and assigned unique numbers upon arrival. They wait in the waiting room for their number to be called by the announcer, who checks the agent line and calls the next customer. Semaphores are used to manage the flow of threads and control access to shared resources such as the information desk, agent line, and announcer. The non-deterministic thread scheduling results in different output every time the program runs.
