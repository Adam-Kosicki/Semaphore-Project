# Semaphore-Project
Thread Communication & Creation & Communication, Multithreading, Semaphore, Concurrency Control, Shared Variables, Infinite Loops

This Java project demonstrates a multithreaded simulation of a DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) system. It showcases the use of threads, synchronization, and concurrency control to model interactions between customers and agents. The project utilizes Java's built-in features for multithreading, including the Semaphore class for managing resources and ensuring synchronized access. By simulating customer-agent interactions in a controlled environment, the project highlights key aspects of concurrent programming and offers insights into the challenges of handling shared resources and communication among threads.
